## Datasets

The proposed method is evaluated on six widely used benchmark datasets covering fine-grained recognition, scene understanding, texture recognition, action classification, and real-world noisy-label learning. The dataset statistics are summarized below.

| Dataset | Classes | Train | Test | Objective |
|--------|--------:|------:|-----:|-----------|
| Caltech101 | 100 | 4,128 | 2,465 | Object recognition |
| Flowers102 | 102 | 4,093 | 2,463 | Flower classification |
| OxfordPets | 37 | 2,944 | 3,669 | Pet recognition |
| UCF101 | 101 | 7,639 | 3,783 | Human action recognition |
| DTD | 47 | 2,820 | 1,692 | Texture classification |
| EuroSAT | 10 | 13,500 | 8,100 | Satellite scene classification |
| Food101N | 101 | 310,009 | 30,300 | Food category recognition |


## Label Noise Protocol

We consider two label noise settings, **symmetric noise** and **asymmetric noise**, with noise rates ranging from **12.5% to 75%**.

| Noise Setting | Corruption Mechanism | Evaluated Rates |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Symmetric Noise | Uniform random label flipping across all non-ground-truth classes | 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%, 75% |
| Asymmetric Noise | Class-dependent flipping toward semantically related classes | 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%, 75% |


## How to Run

Before launching the experiments, please first edit the configuration variables in `run.sh`:

- `dataset`: dataset name  
- `n_shot`: number of shots per class  
- `seed`: random seed  

The script will automatically run experiments under both **symmetric** and **asymmetric** label noise settings, with noise rates ranging from **12.5%** to **75%**.

```bash
bash ./scripts/visprompt/run.sh
